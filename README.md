# Welcome to my iOS Repository!
###### DylbinTheDev's Repo, Supports iOS 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Has arm64 and arm64e support. Most of the packages only support A7 - A14 chipsets. All legacy packages has been updated with 2 arm64e slices to work properly.
This is where I upload my packages to be visible in package managers like Cydia, Sileo, Installer, Zebra and nitoTV.

## How do I add your repo?

Simply launch your Package Manager and add a new "Source" then type https://dylbinthedev.github.io/

## Requirements
- Requires a jailbroken iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV
- Package Manager: Cydia, Sileo, Installer, Zebra, nitoTV
- A device running iOS/iPadOS or tvOS

## Designed with modern package managers in mind.
- This repo is made especially for modern package managers like Sileo, Installer and Zebra, but it still supports Cydia.

## tvOS
- In nitoTV you need to add https://dylbinthedev.github.io/tvos
- Note that the tvOS Repo is in beta and may not function correctly.

## Update Loops in Cydia
- Fuck Cydia, use a better package manager like Sileo,Installer or Zebra.

## Mirror Repositories
- In addition to my own repo, I host mirror repo's too.
- I host a mirror of CoolStar's RepoUnclutter project which is ModMyi and ZodTTD Repo combined with iOS 11+ compatible packages. I also host a mirror of Litten's Repo and Nepeta's old repo.
