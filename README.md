# Welcome to my iOS/tvOS APT Repo!

This is where I upload my packages to be visible in package managers like Cydia, Sileo, Installer, Zebra and nitoTV.

## How do I add your repo?

Simply launch your Package Manager and add a new "Source" then type https://dylbinthedev.github.io/ or click these links.
On nitoTV you need to add https://dylbinthedev.github.io/tvos

[Add to Cydia](https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://dylbinthedev.github.io/ "Add to Cydia")

## Requirements

Most of the packages hosted supports modern versions of iOS/iPadOS being 12.0 and up, but some packages support even iOS 9/10 and 11. You obviously need to be jailbroken to use and download software from this repo. tvOS 10.2.2 - 14
