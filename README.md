# Welcome to my iOS/tvOS APT Repo!

This is where I upload my packages to be visible in package managers like Cydia, Sileo, Installer, Zebra and nitoTV.

## How do I add your repo?

Simply launch your Package Manager and add a new "Source" then type https://dylbinthedev.github.io/ or click these links.
- On nitoTV you need to add https://dylbinthedev.github.io/tvos

[Add to Cydia](https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://dylbinthedev.github.io/ "Add to Cydia")

## Requirements
- Requires a jailbroken iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV
- Package Manager: Cydia, Sileo, Installer, Zebra, nitoTV
- Supports iOS and tvOS

## Designed with modern package managers in mind.
- This repo is made especially for Sileo, Installer and Zebra and you should use it on those, of course Cydia is supported but it's old and slow so why even use it?
